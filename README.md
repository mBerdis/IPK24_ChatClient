Chat client application written in ***C++***, using object oriented approach, that uses ***IPK24-CHAT*** protocol over ***IPv4*** to communicate with the server.

## Build & Run
Project uses ***Makefile*** to handle build. Available commands:
|Command             |Description           |
| ---                | -----------          |
|`make`              | creates ***ipk24chat-client*** executable in project directory |
|`make clean`        | cleans build-generated files |
|`make run`          | builds and runs the app |
|`make runValgrind`  | builds and runs the app using valgrind |
|`make runUdpServCon`| builds and runs the app, will use UDP and reference server in options |
|`make runTcpServCon`| builds and runs the app, will use TCP and reference server in options |

The program ***ipk24chat-client*** accepts following CLI arguments: \
(Table is inspired by the specification in [Assignment\CLI Arguments](https://git.fit.vutbr.cz/NESFIT/IPK-Projects-2024/src/branch/master/Project%201#user-content-cli-arguments))
|Argument | Default value | Accepted values | Description |
| ---     | -----------   | ---             | ----------- |
|`-t`     | User provided | `tcp` / `udp`   | Transport protocol used for connection|
|`-s`     | User provided | IP address or hostname	   | Chat server IP/hostname |
|`-p`     | 4567 | `uint16`	   | Server port |
|`-d`     | 250 | `uint16`	   | UDP confirmation timeout |
|`-r`     | 3 | `uint8`	   | max number of UDP retransmissions  |
|`-h`     | | | Prints program help and exits  |

The program reads user-typed commands from the standard input (`stdin`). Any other input is treated as a message and sent to the server. \
(Table is inspired by the specification in [Assignment\Client behaviour, input and commands](https://git.fit.vutbr.cz/NESFIT/IPK-Projects-2024/src/branch/master/Project%201#user-content-client-behaviour-input-and-commands))

|Command | Parameters | Description |
| ---     | --------  | ----------- |
|`/auth`  | `{username}` `{secret}` `{displayName}` | Tries to authorize user with the server |
|`/join`  | `{channelID}` | Tries to join channel |
|`/rename`  | `{displayName}` | Renames authorized user, will apply to newly sent messages |
|`/help`  | | Prints help about these commands  |

## Problematique
The `IPK24-chat` is built on top of well known transport protocols TCP [RFC9293] or UDP [RFC768]. Since TCP provides reliable delivery, its variant posses little to none challenge. Thus in this section we'll focus on making UDP's connection-less approach more reliable.
### 1. Packet loss
After each sent UDP message (confirm message excluded) we'll await mandatory confirmation message from the server. Lack of this message, within set timespan, will signal packet loss. In that case we'll sent that message again, maximally `udpRetry` amount of times. This limitation will solve the problem when the server is no longer online or the connection is so unreliable that we cannot deliver a single message.

### 2. Packet delay / duplication
To fix this issue we'll give each message a unique identifier. While processing incoming messages we have to check whether we're expecting confirmation message with given unique identifier. If not, discard the message.

## Implementation
### 1. Abstraction
### 2. Terminating connection
